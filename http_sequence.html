A client finds the server's IP with DNS,<br>
Then sends a <b>GET</b> to <b>port 80</b>, no less.<br>
Through <b>TCP</b>, a <b>packet</b> takes flight,<br>
With a <b>URL</b>, <b>headers</b>, and hope in its byte.<br>
The server, in <b>LISTEN</b>, responds with delight,<br>
Serving <b>HTML</b>--what a wonderful sight!
